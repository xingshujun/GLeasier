#GLeasier

This project is the result from my `OpenGL` learning experience. We always have
to setup too many things before we can actually draw something. This library
does most of that. Well, for a condition.

- You will use `glfw3`, `glew`, `assimp`, `opencv`(just to load images, lol).

I will keep update this.
Have fun.
